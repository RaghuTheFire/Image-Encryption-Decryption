# Image-Encryption-Decryption
This C++code uses the FLTK/QT library
for creating the GUI and OpenCV
for image processing.The code provides functionality to open an image, encrypt it, decrypt it, reset it to the original state, and save the encrypted / decrypted image.The encryption and decryption algorithms are based on the provided Python code, which uses a random key matrix to encrypt and decrypt the image.
